Updates:

- Fixed an issue with a deprecated feature the experimental configuration had, that resized all the downloaded images to 4k resolution. Now the images are downloaded in their original resolution, thus preserving the desired aspect ratio. 

- Added categories, pages in order to display more than the default 24 wallpapers, SFW/NSFW toggle options and aspect ratio options. 

- Fixed a typo on the main.rs and Cargo.toml regarding the name of the app.



Instructions:


This work was created as a place to experiment with waldl, and ultimately lead to the here published Rust GUI for wldl.
I chose Rust over Python as I often do because I love cargo for compiling stuff.
The app shows thumbnails and downloads the wallpaper in 4k to your default Downloads folder by clicking on it.
I also changed sxiv for nsxiv, because both the original wldl script and sxiv were from a few years ago.


Compile with:

``` cargo check ```



So you know it compiles.


Then


```cargo run```


if you want to try the binary, or



```cargo build --release```



if you want the fully optimized binary.





The binary will be in the same folder you had the provided files, inside target/release.








Enjoy!
